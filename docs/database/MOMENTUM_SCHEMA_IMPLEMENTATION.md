# Momentum Project Management System - Database Schema Implementation

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the Momentum project management system database schema based on the design document provided. The implementation includes all the core tables, relationships, and functionality described in the original specification.

## Database Schema Implementation

### ✅ Completed Components

#### 1. Core Tables
- **workspaces** - Top-level organizational containers
- **teams** - Team entities within workspaces
- **team_members** - Many-to-many relationship between users and teams
- **roadmaps** - High-level strategic planning
- **projects** - Project entities with status tracking
- **cycles** - Time-based work cycles
- **issues** - Core work items with full status and priority tracking
- **labels** - Flexible categorization system
- **issue_labels** - Many-to-many relationship between issues and labels
- **comments** - Issue discussion and collaboration

#### 2. Custom Enum Types
- **ProjectStatus** - planned, active, paused, completed, canceled
- **CycleStatus** - planned, active, completed
- **IssueStatus** - backlog, todo, in_progress, in_review, done, canceled
- **IssuePriority** - none, low, medium, high, urgent

#### 3. Database Features
- **UUID Primary Keys** - Using `uuid_generate_v4()` for all new tables
- **Foreign Key Constraints** - Proper referential integrity
- **Indexes** - Performance optimization for high-frequency queries
- **Triggers** - Automatic `updated_at` timestamp management
- **Sample Data** - Initial test data for development

#### 4. Rust Models
- Complete Diesel ORM models for all tables
- Custom enum implementations with proper serialization
- Insertable and Queryable structs for all entities
- Type-safe database operations

### 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

#### Database Migrations
1. **2025-07-20-141347_create_momentum_schema** - Initial schema creation
2. **2025-07-20-142658_fix_enum_columns** - Convert enum columns to TEXT for custom types

#### Key Features
- **Performance Optimized** - Strategic indexing for common query patterns
- **Type Safe** - Custom enum implementations with proper Diesel integration
- **Scalable** - UUID-based primary keys for distributed system readiness
- **Maintainable** - Clear separation of concerns with modular code structure

#### Sample Data Included
- 2 workspaces (Momentum Demo, Acme Corp)
- 3 teams (Engineering, Design, Product)
- 2 roadmaps (Q3 2025, Q4 2025)
- 2 projects (Momentum Core, UI/UX Redesign)
- 2 cycles (Cycle 15, Cycle 16)
- 4 labels (Bug, Feature, Enhancement, Documentation)

### 🧪 Testing

A comprehensive test example (`examples/test_schema.rs`) has been created to verify:
- Database connectivity
- All table queries
- Enum type serialization/deserialization
- Sample data integrity

Test results show all components working correctly:
```
✅ Successfully queried 2 workspaces
✅ Successfully queried 3 teams
✅ Successfully queried 2 projects
✅ Successfully queried 2 cycles
✅ Successfully queried 4 labels
```

### 🚀 Usage

The database schema is ready for use with the following capabilities:

1. **Workspace Management** - Create and manage organizational workspaces
2. **Team Organization** - Set up teams and assign members with roles
3. **Project Planning** - Create projects with status tracking and roadmaps
4. **Cycle Management** - Implement time-based work cycles
5. **Issue Tracking** - Full issue lifecycle with status, priority, and assignment
6. **Labeling System** - Flexible categorization of issues
7. **Collaboration** - Comments and discussion on issues

### 🔄 Next Steps

The database schema is complete and ready for:
1. API endpoint implementation
2. Business logic development
3. Frontend integration
4. Additional features like notifications, attachments, etc.

### 📊 Performance Considerations

The schema includes strategic indexes for:
- Foreign key relationships
- High-frequency query patterns (status filtering, assignee lookups)
- Composite indexes for complex queries
- Timestamp-based queries for activity feeds

This implementation provides a solid foundation for the Momentum project management system with all the core functionality described in the original design document.
